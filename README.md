Project Overview:

This project involves creating a simple Python program that functions as a basic calculator. The program will prompt the user to input two numbers and select a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). After the user selects an operation, the program will perform the calculation and display the result.

Objectives:

Develop a user-friendly interface using text-based prompts.
Implement basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Ensure the program handles errors gracefully, such as division by zero or invalid inputs.
Features:

User Input:

The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers.
The user will then choose an operation from the following options:
